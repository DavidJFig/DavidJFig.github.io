                <p>I am a web developer with a background in education. 
                    I have a passion for learning and sharing knowledge. 
                    I am a lifelong learner and I am always looking for 
                    new ways to challenge myself. I am currently working 
                    on expanding my skills in web development and I am 
                    excited to see where this journey will take me.
